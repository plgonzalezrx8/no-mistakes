title: Choosing an Agent
description: Supported AI agents, how to pick one, and how they integrate.
---

`no-mistakes` is agent-agnostic by design. The gate should mean the same thing
regardless of which agent you prefer. The default `agent: auto` setting picks
the first supported native agent available on your system.

The agent is responsible for the parts of the gate that benefit from judgment:
code review, test or lint detection when you have not configured explicit
commands, auto-fixing, and setup-wizard suggestions when you leave prompts
blank.

## How to choose quickly

- Leave `agent: auto` if one good agent is already installed and you do not need repo-specific behavior.
- Set a repo-level `agent` override when one codebase clearly works better with a different tool.
- Set explicit `commands.test` and `commands.lint` if you want deterministic command execution regardless of agent choice.

That last point matters: the agent helps fill in gaps, but explicit repo
commands are still the strongest way to make the gate predictable.

## Supported agents

| Agent | Binary | Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | `claude` | Subprocess per invocation, JSONL streaming |
| Codex | `codex` | Subprocess per invocation, JSONL events |
| Rovo Dev | `acli` | Persistent HTTP server, SSE streaming |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | Persistent HTTP server, SSE streaming |
| Pi | `pi` | Subprocess per invocation, JSONL events |
| ACP target | `acpx` | Optional user-installed ACP bridge |

## Setting the agent

### Global default

```yaml
# ~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml
agent: auto
```

### Per-repo override

```yaml
# .no-mistakes.yaml
agent: codex
```

Repo config takes precedence over global config.

### Optional ACP target

If you install `acpx` separately, you can opt into any ACP target with the `acp:` prefix.

```yaml
# ~/.no-mistakes/config.yaml or .no-mistakes.yaml
agent: acp:gemini
```

`agent: auto` only probes native agents.
It does not auto-select ACP targets.

## Where agent choice matters most

Changing agents most directly affects:

- review quality and tone
- test and lint detection when commands are not configured
- how good auto-fix attempts are for your stack
- branch name and commit subject suggestions in the setup wizard

It does **not** change the pipeline order or the meaning of a passed gate.

## Binary resolution

By default, `no-mistakes` resolves `agent: auto` by checking for supported native agents on your `PATH` in this order:

1. `claude`
2. `codex`
3. `opencode`
4. `acli` with `rovodev` support
5. `pi`

The default binary names are:

| Agent | Default binary name |
|---|---|
| `claude` | `claude` |
| `codex` | `codex` |
| `rovodev` | `acli` |
| `opencode` | `opencode` |
| `pi` | `pi` |
| `acp:<target>` | `acpx` |

When the daemon is running through a managed service, that `PATH` comes from your login shell environment on macOS and Linux plus common user, Homebrew, and system binary directories. On Windows it reuses the current process environment instead of reloading a login shell. If native agent discovery still does not resolve the binary you expect, use an explicit `agent_path_override`.

Override paths in global config:

```yaml
agent_path_override:
  claude: /Users/you/bin/claude
  codex: /opt/homebrew/bin/codex
  rovodev: /usr/local/bin/acli
  opencode: /usr/local/bin/opencode
  pi: /usr/local/bin/pi
```

For ACP targets, set `acpx_path` instead of `agent_path_override`:

```yaml
acpx_path: /Users/you/bin/acpx
```

You can also set extra CLI flags for native agents in global config with
`agent_args_override`. This is useful for things like model selection,
reasoning level, or permission mode. Keep this in global config only, since it
reflects your local agent setup rather than repo policy.

## Agent interface

All agents implement the same interface. Each invocation receives:

- **Prompt** - the task description (review this diff, fix these findings, etc.)
- **CWD** - the worktree directory
- **JSONSchema** - optional structured output schema for typed responses
- **OnChunk** - callback for streaming text output to the TUI

Each invocation returns:

- **Output** - structured JSON output; native structured responses are returned as-is, while text-parsed fallbacks are validated before return and may use `null` for optional fields
- **Text** - raw text output
- **Usage** - token counts (input, output, cache read, cache creation)

Transient API and network failures are retried up to three times with exponential backoff. Retry messages are streamed through the same `OnChunk` path shown in the TUI.

## Intent extraction

When `intent.enabled` is true, no-mistakes reads recent local transcripts from Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Rovo Dev during the `intent` pipeline step.
It matches sessions against the changed files, summarizes the likely author intent with the configured pipeline agent, includes that summary as untrusted context in review checks and fixes, test detection and fixes, lint detection and fixes, documentation checks and fixes, and PR prompts, and renders it in generated PR descriptions.

Transcript readers collect user and assistant text messages but exclude tool call output.
They read Claude Code transcripts from `~/.claude/projects`, Codex metadata from `~/.codex/state_*.sqlite` plus referenced rollout files, OpenCode messages from `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/opencode.db` or `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`, and Rovo Dev sessions from `~/.rovodev/sessions`.
Pi and ACP transcripts are not currently read for intent extraction.
The selected transcript text is sent to the configured pipeline agent for summarization during the `intent` step, which may incur an additional agent or API invocation.
Before summarization, no-mistakes excludes tool output, redacts likely secrets, strips common prompt-control markers, and clamps long transcripts while preserving the beginning and end.
no-mistakes stores derived intent summaries and matching metadata in `~/.no-mistakes/state.sqlite`, including the source, session ID, and match score on each run plus cached summaries for matching transcript sessions.
It does not store raw transcript text in its database.
When a transcript matches, the step logs the matched source, score, and sanitized inferred intent.

Use `intent.disabled_readers` to disable specific transcript sources, or set `intent.enabled: false` to opt out entirely.

## Claude

Spawns a `claude` subprocess for each invocation with `--output-format stream-json`. By default it also adds `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, unless you already set your own Claude permission flag through `agent_args_override`. Reads JSONL events from stdout. Supports native structured output via `--json-schema`.

## Codex

Spawns a `codex` subprocess for each invocation with `exec --json`. When structured output is requested, no-mistakes also writes a normalized schema file and passes it with `--output-schema`. By default it also adds `--sandbox workspace-write`, unless you already set your own Codex sandbox or bypass flag through `agent_args_override`. Reads JSONL events. Structured output is returned from the final `agent_message` text, with fallback parsing that accepts JSON fences, inline fence markers, or a final bare JSON object after prose, then validates the result against the normalized schema.

## Rovo Dev

Starts a persistent HTTP server (`acli rovodev serve`) on first use and reuses it across invocations. If a reused server refuses a connection, no-mistakes discards it and retries with a fresh server. Any `agent_args_override.rovodev` flags are inserted before no-mistakes' managed serve flags. Communicates via REST API and SSE streaming. Each invocation creates a session, sends the prompt, streams results, then deletes the session. Structured output is handled by injecting schema instructions into a system prompt, then parsing the final text with fallback parsing that accepts JSON fences, inline fence markers, or a final bare JSON object after prose, and validates the result against the requested schema while allowing `null` for optional fields.

## OpenCode

Starts a persistent HTTP server (`opencode serve`) on first use and reuses it across invocations. If a reused server refuses a connection, no-mistakes discards it and retries with a fresh server. Any `agent_args_override.opencode` flags are inserted before no-mistakes' managed serve flags. Similar session lifecycle to Rovo Dev: create session, send message, stream SSE events until idle, delete session. Supports `json_schema` format in the message request for structured output. When native structured output is absent, it falls back to parsing the final text with the same JSON fence and bare-object fallback, validating that fallback result against the requested schema while allowing `null` for optional fields.

## Pi

Spawns a `pi` subprocess for each invocation with `--mode json --no-session`.
Any `agent_args_override.pi` flags are inserted before no-mistakes' managed flags.
Reads JSONL events from stdout and streams incremental text deltas to the TUI.
When structured output is requested, no-mistakes injects the JSON schema into the prompt and validates the final text response.

## ACP via acpx

ACP support is optional and requires a separately installed `acpx` binary.
Use `agent: acp:<target>` to run a target known to acpx, for example `agent: acp:gemini`.

For custom ACP target commands, define a global override:

```yaml
agent: acp:local-gemini
acp_registry_overrides:
  local-gemini: node /opt/mock-acp-agent.mjs
```

no-mistakes invokes acpx with JSON output, approve-all permissions, denied non-interactive permission prompts, and the repo worktree as `--cwd`.
Structured output is handled by appending the requested JSON schema to the prompt and validating the final assistant text.

## Checking agent availability

Run `no-mistakes doctor` to see which native agent binaries are installed and available:

```
$ no-mistakes doctor
  ✓ git
  ✓ gh
  ✓ data directory
  ✓ database
  ✓ daemon running
  ✓ claude
  – codex (not found)
  – acli (not found)
  – opencode (not found)
  – pi (not found)
```

`✓` = available, `–` = not found (optional), `✗` = problem detected.

For `agent: acp:<target>`, make sure `acpx` is installed on `PATH` or set `acpx_path` in global config.
`no-mistakes doctor` does not validate ACP targets.
